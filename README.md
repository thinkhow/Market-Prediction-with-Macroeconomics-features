# Predicting the S&P 500
​
The goal of our project is to find a better prediction of the S&P 500 with external data including monetary policies and decisions from the Federal reserve, profitability and financial decisions of s&p 500 companies, etc. (Please see our dataset description for a complete list).
​
We studied a couple of machine learning models for and improved performance of the best one --- the Facebook Prophet model, with added external features. We used a unique nonlinear model and a special computing scheme and a feature selection algorithm.
​
Our model is able to reduce the Mean Squared Error and reflect the COVID19 period market crash and rebound when that period of time is included.
