2021/05/15 4:30pm Hao: Since we haven't been able to get the daily data of sp500, I tried playing with fbprophet on Nasdaq all time daily. But there is a issue with the plot. See the file "abnormal plot from fbprophet.ipynb". Can anyone fix it? Plus, I wanted to put these in the scratch work folder, but I don't know how to retrieve to csv data from the data folder properly (see the notebook I added in the scratch work folder). Can anyone help me? 

2021/05/17 11:30am Shelby: Updated the documents README with a description of each document and our To-Do list. Over the weekend found the SP 500 daily data, which I believe Hao uploaded (?).

2021/05/21 11:00am Hao: Based on Shelby's great work on data preprocessing, I replaced p/e (price to earning) ratio by eps, since eps (earning per share) is not directly associated to the stock price (market index), which is a better objective measurement for earnings of S&P 500 than p/e. Shelby's original work is saved in another file. All in the scratch folder. Data for sp500 with additional columns are now in the data folder. Namely total_df.csv

Plus, I really want to add fed total assets, even if provides less data, since fed total assets have become a really important indicator for Fed's Quantitive Easing policy creating a long term bull market since 2008. But I haven't figured out how after hours of trying.

2021/05/24 11:00am Shelby: Added div and eps to the total_df, (interpolated to trading days).

2021/05/27 8:00pm Shelby: Added readme file to new data folder.

2021/05/28 12:00am Shelby: Added/updated readme's for each front-facing folder.
