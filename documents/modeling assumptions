Keep track of what the assumptions are and WHY they are made

Our data comes in different time intervals. For example, SP500 prices are only reported on trading days, bond yields are reported monthly, federal assets is reported weekly, and p/e ratio is reported quarterly.
We assume in our models that investors make decisions based on (and hence that markets are driven by) the last available report of these data.

When using FB Prophet, we assume that there is a cap on the S&P 500 market price (which is standard for stock prediction using FB Prophet).
This means that FB Prophet fits the data with a piece-wise linear function instead of a logistic regression.
